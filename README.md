# Asteroidz
Remake of classical Asteroids game using C# and Unity game engine.

You can download the game from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OG5ibOWF6V6RIvXnCakpY_PR0AbERJ6E?usp=sharing). Unzip the file and play!
The rule is simple. Shoot and destroy as many asteroids as you can. You can see the controls in Help Menu.

To run the project, open the project in Unity and Unity will download all dependencies. Make sure your Unity version is compatible with project version.
